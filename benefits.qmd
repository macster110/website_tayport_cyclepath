We believe the Tentsmuir Cycle Link is a vital piece of community infastracture that will bring numerous benefits to North East Fife and beyond.

### 🌱 Connecting our Communities
The Tentsmuir Cycle Link will mean there is a continuous, safe and efficient cycle path from St Andrews to Dundee and beyond. This link between towns such as Tayport and Leuchars, will allow more access to local services without the need to rely on buses, bring more business to Tayport and Leuchars, make safe cycle commuting possible and generally greatly enhance community connectivity in North East Fife. 

### 🛡 Safe
Lots of folk are put off cycling by our pot holed and sometimes dangerous roads. A cycle path open up cycling to a lagrer number of people, especially families and children promoting an active life style. They also reduce the number of cyclists using busy roads meaning less congestion and less frustrating journey for all.   

### 🏃‍♂️ Boosts Health and Active Lifestyles
Cycle paths encourage more cycling and active travel boosting health. The Tentsmuir Cycle Link will be a beautiful route passing through forests and countryside. Studies show that even just a ten minutes in nature can greatly boost mental health and well being. 

#v# 🌳 A Biodiveristy Corridor
We plan on planting native hedges and wildflowers alongside the path encouraging insects, birds an dother wildlife and creating a wildlife coridor between Leuchars and Tayport. 

### 🌱 Cuts CO₂ Emissions
Cycle paths take cars off the road and studies have shown they can signficantly reduce carbon emmissions helping us reach a less carbonm intesive society.
