We believe the Tentsmuir Cycle Link is a vital piece of **community infrastructure** that will bring numerous benefits to North East Fife and beyond.

### üå± Connecting our Communities
The Tentsmuir Cycle Link will mean there is a continuous, safe and efficient cycle path from St Andrews to Dundee and beyond. This link between towns such as Tayport and Leuchars, will allow more access to local services without the need to rely on buses, bring more business to Tayport and Leuchars, make safe cycle commuting possible and generally greatly enhance community connectivity in North East Fife.¬†

#### - Providing our communities with options
The Tentsmuir Cycle Link will provide an alternative to car travel for many local journeys. This is especially important given the recent cuts to bus services in Tayport and Leuchars. For example, there is secure cycle storage in Leuchars which allows folk to catch buses onward to St or Cupar. A single cycle path also means

#### - Access to Leuchars Railway Station
It will be a 9km (30 - 45 mins) cycle along the cycle path from Tayport to Leuchars railway station. This will make it possible to commute by train to Edinburgh and beyond without the need for a car.

#### - More footfall in Tayport
The cycle path will bring more people into Tayport, especially from Leuchars and St Andrews. This will bring more business to local shops, cafes and pubs.

### üõ°Ô∏è Safer for Everyone
Lots of folk are put off cycling by our pot holed and sometimes dangerous roads. Currently the options to cycle between St Andrews and Dundee or Tayport involve either a very busy and narrow road or taking a long detour via Tentsmuir on gravel track unsuitable for road bikes. The Tentsmuir Cycle link will provide a continuous, **segregated**, **efficient** link for cyclists avoiding busy roads meaning a safer journey for cyclists and less congestion and frustration for cars.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Boosts Health and Active Lifestyles
Cycle paths encourage more cycling and active travel boosting health. The Tentsmuir Cycle link **will** encourage community and open up cycling destinations via bike to far more people. It will be a beautiful route passing through forests and countryside and studies show that even just **ten minutes** in nature can greatly boost mental health and well being.

### üå≥ A **Biodiversity** Corridor
We plan on planting native hedges and wildflowers alongside the path encouraging insects, birds an dother wildlife and creating a wildlife **corridor** between Leuchars and Tayport.

### üå± Cuts CO‚ÇÇ Emissions
Cycle paths take cars off the road and studies have shown they can **significantly** reduce carbon emissions helping us reach a less carbon-intensive society.
